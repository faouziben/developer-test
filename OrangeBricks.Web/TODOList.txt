# We need to use the Factory pattern to create the builder and Handler class, because at the moment the creation of these class 
can be difficult to maintain if we want to expand the website.And it can cause a lot of problem in team environment.
The idea is to create an interface to define the mandatory methods to create the class, for example IHttpHandler and IHttpHandlerFactory 
Then create factory for Offer and property.

# Update the unit test by using the previous factory

# Security recommandation:
	- Dont use cookies to store user's password and consider encrypting information in cookies.
	- Use error handling. Include a finally block in which you release resources in case of failure
	- Test size limits of user input before using or storing it
	- Test the size of the number of queries, if there are unreasonable number o records 
	- Use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL), if we send sensitive information.
	- Verify the email when a user register
	- SQL injection : filter user input by verifying throught validation example: Int32.Parse to verify if its an integer
	  and apply HTml encoding to string to avoid HTML interpretation
	- Use Windows event logging and examine the logs frequently for suspicious activity

#get a Bigger website
	-Probably change the type of database like cassandra to manage the number of users
	-Set up Load Balancing through cloud computing for example
	-Use TDD 
	-Use Javascript Framework like AngularJs, React.js ..
